This code is a portion of my Particle Physics PHYSICS129 final project at Berkeley. Object-oriented programming in Python was used to create a Monte Carlo simulation of > 1 GeV electrons propagating through a 1-D lead tungstate (PbWO4) crystal, as in the electromagnetic calorimeter used in the CMS experiment in CERN. The energy density plot generated by the simulation is well modeled by a gamma distribution. Fitting techniques were applied to identify parameters of the model for a range of energies.
